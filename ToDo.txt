ToDo: 


Graph: 

    The graph.h has lots of public members, so mostly i will be adding to the private
    members, or maybe a little to the public. 

    go in and fix up graphattemt.cpp (rename to graph), this is partially written code
    with a todo 

    then test this on the graphtests.cpp file AND add more tests
