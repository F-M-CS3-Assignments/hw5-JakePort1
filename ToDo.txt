ToDo: 
    - add more tests for the graph function, 
    log into fandm server to test if it works there but also the use valgrind 
    go back and test this again on line 99: assert(q.ToString() == soln1 || q.ToString() == soln2 || q.ToString() == soln3);



Graph: 

    The graph.h has lots of public members, so mostly i will be adding to the private
    members, or maybe a little to the public. 

    go in and fix up graphattemt.cpp (rename to graph), this is partially written code
    with a todo 

    then test this on the graphtests.cpp file AND add more tests
